===============

This is an android app that helps users maintain a To-Do list for tasks on different days, with tasks entered through handwriting, and gestures for perforaming different actions. The gestures were selected based on user study with users of varying expertise levels.

Essential features:
- add a new task 
- mark a task as completed 
- delete a task 
- navigate through different days' tasks 
- undo and redo actions.
The design method was as follows: We created persona of a graduate student, who needs a To-Do App that will not consume much of her time. Keeping the persona and the lessons learnt from several papers that we have been reading on gesture set designing in mind, we came up with the first set of gestures for the App. In order to improve our gesture set, we then conducted a Survey to validate the proposed gestures and their associated actions. We chose 20 of our friends as subjects for the survey. Results of the survey indicated that a majority of the participants were in agreement with the chosen gesture set. 

The resulting command/gesture set was as follows: 
- add a new task: button (not NUI command/other feature)
- mark a task as completed: Tick gesture 
- delete a task: single stroke cross gesture 
- go to next day: single stroke right arrow 
- go to previous day: single/double stroke left arrow 
- undo: anticlockwise circle and redo: clockwise circle. 

One important feature was that the tasks for each day were stored in separate files and loaded when the relevant screen was navigated to.
